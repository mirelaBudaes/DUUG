Done by uSiteBuilder:
- Templates
- Document types

Done by Courier:
- Content
- Data types
- Dictionary items
	- Make sure to create a "root" dictionary item as a parent for all dictionary items, that way you can deploy them all at once (otherwise you'd have to deploy them seperately)

Done by Courier (but these should rarely happen):
- Macros (if any, avoid creating them and use Razor + the FileLocation attribute)
- Media (if deploy is needed, remember: deploy also happens when they are linked to a content item)
- Media Types
- Languages

Done by deploy script:
- Stylesheets
- Javascript
- Images
- Templates
- Razor files
- XSLT files / usercontrol files (but not the macros!)
- Masterpage files
- bin
- Config files (+ transforms - transforms not finished yet!)
